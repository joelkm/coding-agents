# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop Synerxgy, a professional social networking platform for the esports industry, with features for gaming profiles, social networking, and career development.

## Key Knowledge
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL/Supabase (relational data), MongoDB (social data), Redis (caching/sessions)
- **Architecture**: Hybrid database design with three-tier application architecture (presentation, application, data layers)
- **Containerization**: Docker-based development with different modes (development with hot reload, production with optimized builds)
- **API Strategy**: REST API for CRUD operations and GraphQL for complex queries with relationships
- **Development Tools**: Vite for frontend build, Alembic for database migrations, Pydantic for validation
- **Key Components**: Gaming profiles with roles/ELO, professional experiences, social features (posts/comments/reactions), user connections
